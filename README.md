# Design Patterns

Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder. A design pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.

## What is a Design Pattern?

Christopher Alexander says, "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

The designs patterns are _descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context._

### Elements of a Pattern

1. **Pattern Name**: A handle used to describe a Design Problem, it's solution.

2. **The Problem**: Describes when to apply the pattern.

3. **The Solution**: Descibes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities and collaborations.

4. **The Consequences**: These are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
